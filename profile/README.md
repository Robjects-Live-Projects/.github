## Hi there 👋
## Welcome to this GitHub Organization


##Overview:
Here, I will provide details and documentation on projects concerning YouTube/Twitch channels "Robjects" (linked videos and respective channels at bottom of description) in where I overview prior DIY projects that had been created completely on-the-spot and live completely determined by you guys, the amazing viewers of the live recording sessnions. 

On top of difficulty presented in just finishing one gadget, start to finish, in one stream session, I provide my chat the opportunity to abuse me with options and certain deliverables mandated from polls created as I progressively navigate through steps as a part of my entire engineering design.  

Some examples shown in videos, but most certainly not limited to are:
1. Giving live viewers the opportunity to select type of hardware utilized given list of all options.
2. Allowing live viewers to force design contraints such as requiring a self built enclosure built from personal CAD models
3.
4.
5.##########stopped here##########
6. Forcing level of 
7. gadget built, force me to adhere to hardware contraints and provide tediuous, specific solution that seriously comprimise the success of finishing before the stream otherwise completely 

With no prior knowledge of the build objective. extreme time-critical deadlines that was using experience  with   the entire engineering process with time-critical deadlines. Each repository in this organization will represent further details on one project that explains the relevant build details that had been determined as a result of live polls, questions and feedback from channel's subscribers.

- objectives and intended gadget

- live, on-the-spot full product builds 

Documentation is developed for following days/weeks after the initial live recording session that would be followed up with a summarizing YouTube video, highlighting major events occurred on YouTube, engineering build constraints and extreme challenges presented as project procedures change off the whim of your wants.

presented from chat and poll  viewership and chat crazy decisions  for those interested in builds that didn't get the opportunity to partake in the live video.


as well-detailed documentation would hinder viewership interactive and thus, lower entertainment value.
