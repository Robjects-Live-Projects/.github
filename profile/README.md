## Hi there 👋
## Welcome to this GitHub Organization


##Overview:
Here, I will provide details and documentation on projects concerning YouTube/Twitch channels "Robjects" (linked videos and respective channels at bottom of description) in where I overview prior DIY projects that had been created completely on-the-spot and live completely determined by you guys, the amazing viewers of the live recording sessnions. 

On top of difficulty presented in just finishing one gadget only, building from start to finish in one ongoing stream session with little to no breaks, I provide, very reluctantly I may add, my chat the opportunity to abuse me with certain project deliverables which could be entirely unrelated and related to the concerning solution. This is determined by interactive and engaging tracking of donation goals with tasks forced upon reaching goals. Additionally, the project constantly gets updated, with the option of rejecting my proposed solution steps, or forcing me to adhere to ridiculous, time-destroying deliverables that stems from interest, be it malicious or not, interest to see a particular design tool/practice used in the creating the final prototype.

Some examples shown in videos, but most certainly not limited to are:
1. Giving live viewers the opportunity to select type of hardware utilized given list of all options.
2. Allowing live viewers to force design contraints such as requiring a self built enclosure built from personal CAD models
3. Denying the usage of outspoken intended usage of programming language, microcontroller used, and/or software tool used from varying level of programming language used (arduino vs. terminal development)
4.

With no prior knowledge of the build objective. extreme time-critical deadlines that was using experience  with   the entire engineering process with time-critical deadlines. Each repository in this organization will represent further details on one project that explains the relevant build details that had been determined as a result of live polls, questions and feedback from channel's subscribers.

- live, on-the-spot full product builds 

Documentation is developed for following days/weeks after the initial live recording session that would be followed up with a summarizing YouTube video, highlighting major events occurred on YouTube, engineering build constraints and extreme challenges presented as project procedures change off the whim of your wants.

presented from chat and poll  viewership and chat crazy decisions  for those interested in builds that didn't get the opportunity to partake in the live video.


as well-detailed documentation would hinder viewership interactive and thus, lower entertainment value.
